\section{Introduction}
VLSEE is a collection of scripts used in and with a large scale spike sorting
process. A section is dedicated to each of the scripts detailing behavior
and usage. [Deprecated] proceeds the titles of scripts that are no longer
actively maintained or improved.

\section{\texttt{simple\_snr}}
\texttt{simple\_snr} is a function that calculates the mean signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and simply returns an array of units whose mean SNR falls below
a given threshold.

\section{\texttt{get\_sane}}
\texttt{get\_sane} is function that returns an array of indices of bad units
based on some simple criteria. Note that bad units are considered to be those
that fall \emph{outside} the valid range of these parameters. It should function
as a basic sanity check before any sorting process to prevent garbage units
from causing a ``garbage--in--garbage--out'' effect.
\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{l c r}
Value&Minimum&Maximum\\
Peak-to-peak Voltage (V\ensuremath{_{pp}})&\ensuremath{60 \mu}V&\ensuremath{350 \mu}V\\
Absolute Voltage&\ensuremath{-350 \mu}V&\ensuremath{350 \mu}V\\
Wave Count&200\footnote{This minimum is 0 if this function is run at the penultimate
step}&\ensuremath{\infty}\\ 
Coefficient of Variation (Magnitude)&0&0.4
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Coefficient of Variation}
The calculation of this parameter is motivated by the observation that most
units that are considered to be artifacts are very noisy around the peaks.
Here, the mean of the lowest point of the unit is considered to be the peak
and the coefficient of variation is defined as:
\begin{equation}
        c_v = \sigma/\mu
\end{equation}
were \ensuremath{\sigma} is the standard deviation of the minimum of the
waveforms and \ensuremath{\mu} is the minimum of the mean waveform. The
absolute value of the coefficient of variation is used in the function to
simplify the process.

\subsection{Usage}
Example: 

\texttt{badunits = get\_sane(do\_units, spiketimes, bestchannel, wavedir, sampling\_rate, ispen)}
Description of parameters:
\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{l r}
\texttt{do\_units}&The indicies of units to check\\
\texttt{spiketimes}&The cell array of spike times\\
\texttt{wavedir}&The director where the waveforms are store\\
\texttt{sampling\_rate}&The sampling frequency\footnote{currently unused}\\
\texttt{ispen} (1=True, 0=False)&Whether this function is being run just after \texttt{get\_penultimate\_units}
\end{longtable}
\end{center}
